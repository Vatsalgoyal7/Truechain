🌿 TrueChain
Blockchain-Based Food Traceability & Smart Certification Platform

TrueChain is a secure, blockchain-powered traceability platform designed to ensure transparent, tamper-proof food and beverage supply chains — from farm to fork.

It enables real-time tracking, smart certification, and verified provenance using blockchain technology.
